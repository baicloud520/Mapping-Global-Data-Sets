# Mapping-Global-Data-Sets

# With the help of this code you will learn how to make a map using Plotlyâ€™s 
# beginner-friendly mapping tool for location-based data. You will create
# visualizations that clearly show the global distribution of all Covid-19 
# cases and how significant each one was.

# Data is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and you will convert
# it into JSON (Java Script Object Notation) format.
